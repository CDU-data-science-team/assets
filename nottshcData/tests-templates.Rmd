# Background

The CDU Data Science Team are using and building a R package called {nottshcData} that uses get_ and tidy_ functions to get data from a SQL data warehouse in a consistent way. Each table used in the data warehouse has corresponding functions but there are also functions for calculations. More was written about it by Milan Wiedemannon the [team blog](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/posts/2021-08-06-nottshcverse/).

The following code snippets are related to the files needed to connect to SQL servers and the message file upon connection. These files must be incorporated into a package to work.

Note where <> is used this is for areas where code needs to be updated.

# Creating tests

The easiest way to create a test script is to use {usethis}, putting the name of the file in the quotations:

```{r}
usethis::use_test(name = "")
```

Tests should be the same name as the file the code relates to so for tests relating to the R script `public-demographics.R` type:


```{r}
usethis::use_test("public-demographics")
```

and then the file will be automatically generated into the folder `tests/testthat` as `public-demographics.R`

# Code to copy

```{r }
# <table> ----
## get() ----

testthat::test_that("<table> - get() function tested", {
  n_cols <- 9

  df <- get_() %>%
    head(5) %>%
    dplyr::collect()

  testthat::expect_equal(
    ncol(df), n_cols
  )

  testthat::expect_gt(
    nrow(df), 0
  )
})

# Testing end dates include the last date (from `to = ` parameter), using a team
# that is time sensitive rather than teams that default to midnight
## Filter by dates ----
test_that("<table> - filter by dates", {

  start_date <- "2020-01-01"
  end_date <- "2020-02-01"

  df <- get_(
    from = start_date,
    to = end_date
  ) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(
      min_date = min(date, na.rm = TRUE),
      max_date = max(date, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
    dplyr::collect()


  testthat::expect_equal(
    df$min_date, start_date
  )

  testthat::expect_equal(
    df$max_date, end_date
  )

})

## select_vars ----
test_that("<table> - select_vars = FALSE tested", {

  n_cols <- 25

  df <- get_(select_vars = FALSE) %>%
    head(5) %>%
    dplyr::collect()

  testthat::expect_equal(
    ncol(df), n_cols
  )

  testthat::expect_gt(
    nrow(df), 0
  )

  df2 <- get_(select_vars = FALSE) %>%
    tidy_() %>%
    head(5) %>%
    dplyr::collect()

  testthat::expect_equal(
    ncol(df2), n_cols
  )

  testthat::expect_gt(
    nrow(df2), 0
  )
})


## get() and tidy() ----

testthat::test_that("<table> - get() and tidy() functions tested", {
  n_cols <- 9

  df <- get_() %>%
    tidy_() %>%
    head(5) %>%
    dplyr::collect()

  testthat::expect_equal(
    ncol(df), n_cols
  )

  testthat::expect_gt(
    nrow(df), 0
  )
})

## SQL names ----

testthat::test_that("<table> - tidy_names = FALSE tested", {
  # SQL
  sql_names <- c(
    "<list>"
  )

  df <- get_() %>%
    tidy_(tidy_names = FALSE) %>%
    head(5) %>%
    dplyr::collect()

  testthat::expect_named(
    df %>% dplyr::select(1:3), sql_names,
    ignore.order = TRUE, ignore.case = FALSE
  )

  # r
  r_names <- c(
    "<list>"
  )

  df2 <- get_() %>%
    tidy_() %>%
    head(5) %>%
    dplyr::select(1:3) %>%
    dplyr::collect()

  testthat::expect_named(
    df2, r_names,
    ignore.order = TRUE, ignore.case = FALSE
  )

  # columns
  n_cols <- 9

  testthat::expect_equal(
    ncol(df), n_cols
  )

  testthat::expect_gt(
    nrow(df), 0
  )
})


## Warnings given ----

testthat::test_that("<table> - Message when function used", {
  message <- "list message"

  expect_message(get_() %>% head(5),
                 message,
                 fixed = TRUE
  )

})

## Errors ----

testthat::test_that("<table> - Error messages", {
  error <- "At least one of the arguments ('filter_alive',
                      'filter_died') must be set to TRUE"
  
  expect_error(get_() %>%
                 tidy_(
                   parameter =
                 ), error,
               fixed = TRUE
  )
})
