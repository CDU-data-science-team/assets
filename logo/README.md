# Logos

## NHS Branding

[NHS branding](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/) is used for colours and font in line with Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's recommendations. 

> The NHS logo is protected by law. It is a UK trade mark owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.  It is also protected by copyright. Only original artwork files for the NHS logo should be used. You should not attempt to recreate it yourself.

The lozenge logo can be downloaded from the [NHS branding site](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/nhs-logo/).

## Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust

Logos use for any branding on behalf of the Trust are detailed on the [Intranet page on branding](https://connect/forms-and-templates#Corporate%20templates%20and%20branding). From the [branding documentation](https://connect/download.cfm?doc=docm93jijm4n10809.doc&ver=59056) and [logos](https://connect/communications-documents-and-resources):

> The Trust NHS logo should always be positioned in the top right corner of any product or publication.  If possible use the logo on a white/pale background for maximum contrast and keep the logo proportional - don’t squash or stretch it!  No other logos, text or images should be used adjacent to/level with the NHS logo ie in the left corner or centre.
>
> NEVER use more than one NHS logo. If an initiative is shared with several NHS trusts then the single NHS lozenge should be used. Please size it as below along with a supporting line of text crediting the relevant NHS organisations, e.g. “X healthcare trust and X Clinical Commissioning Group working together”. 
>
> The ‘Making a difference’ logo should always be in conjunction with, not in place of, the Nottinghamshire Healthcare logo. The ‘Making a difference’ logo should be positioned in the bottom left corner. No other logos should be used.  

Note that the [presentation slides](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/presentation-template) are based on the Trust's template PowerPoint templates and use a specific landscape picture.

Please contact [Communications](https://www.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/press-and-media) regarding the use of these logos for anything other than Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust business.
